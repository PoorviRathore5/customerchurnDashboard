Insights:

Product Engagement:

Customers with only 1 product or those with 3 or more products are more likely to churn. Strategies should focus on maintaining engagement for customers with multiple products and improving satisfaction for those with only one product.
Age Factor:

The churn rate increases significantly with age, particularly for customers aged 45-55. Tailored retention strategies should be developed for older customers, possibly focusing on services and products that cater to their specific needs.
Credit Score Impact:

Customers with poor credit scores have a higher likelihood of churning. This suggests a need for improved financial support and customer service for customers with lower credit scores.
Gender Differences:

Males have a higher churn rate than females. Understanding the reasons behind this difference could help in developing gender-specific retention strategies.
Active Status:

There is a stark contrast in churn rates between active and inactive customers. Efforts should be made to convert inactive customers to active status through targeted engagement initiatives.
Tenure Influence:

The churn rate is highest during the first year and decreases with longer tenure, with slight fluctuations. This indicates the importance of the initial customer experience and ongoing engagement to reduce churn in the early stages of the customer lifecycle.
